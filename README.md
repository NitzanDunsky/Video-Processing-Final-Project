This project was completed as part of the 'Video Processing' course at Tel Aviv University.
The task involved receiving an input video, stabilizing it, subtracting the background, overlaying the moving object onto a new background, and tracking its movement.
This project showcases the use of essential OpenCV (CV2) functions to implement key video and image processing algorithms such as SIFT, projection, KNN, and matting.
